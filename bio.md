# About Me

Here are a few interesting facts about me and my life. It been quite a journey for me to get here, however it is the path I choose and no one elses. I been through a lot over the few years to include getting married to one of my best friends Jashni, PCS orders, attending a multiple family friends' weddings, and just about any other thing you can think of while being in the military. Now I am just trying to take life day by day and trying not to stress to much about certain events that is not under my control. 

#### Few things I like to do while on my free time include the following:
1. Spending time with my wife and dog.
1. Enjoying video games undistracted.
1. Watching several of my TV shows.
1. Working out whenever I have time.
