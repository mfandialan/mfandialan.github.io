# About Michael Fandialan

Here are a few interesting facts my life. It has been quite a journey for me to get here, however it is the path I choose and no one elses. I been through a lot over the few years to include getting married to one of my best friends Jashni, PCS orders, attending multiple friends' weddings, and just about any other thing you can think of while being in the military. Now I am just trying to take life day by day and trying not to stress to much about certain events that are not under my control. 

### Spending my free time included the following: 
1. Spending time with Jashni and our dog.
1. Traveling with Jashni
1. Watching several of my TV shows.
1. Working out whenever I have time.
1. ***Enjoying video games undistracted.*** I am currently playing:
+ Monster Hunter World
+ Dissidia NT Final Fantasy

*Here are two photos of myself, Jashni, and of our dog Kuni.*
