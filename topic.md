## Professional Gaming
---
The topic that I decided to talk about is professional gaming. Today, professional gaming can be considered a very competitive sport. By sport I mean an electronic sport. I choose this topic because I myself enjoy playing video games and without computer technology professional gaming would not exist. Technology has gotten to a point where a simple pass time is now able to generate billions of dollars. However, as much as I like to play videos games I am no were near as good as those who are professional gamers. Here are two images as to show how big the professional gaming world has gotten.
